# CaptureTheRequests 
This is a simple app in Python using Flask that'll create an Endpoint for any CTF challenge.

It'll log every requests it receives inside a file to simplify the process of checking for responses from targets.

## for now it can : 
- Log and capture any requests made on its endpoints
- Serv as an HTTP server for any files / payload that could be needed

## Next steps
- add a way for the app to catch and offer a connection to any reverse_shells it receives
- add a new endpoint to download files instead of rendering them
